# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

## üìñ About This Repository

Welcome to my data science and analysis portfolio. This repository documents my journey of building 30 hands-on projects, progressing from foundational data analysis to advanced machine learning and end-to-end model deployment.

This collection is designed to serve as a practical demonstration of my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, data visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The projects are organized into 4 Tiers, reflecting a structured learning path from basic analysis to advanced, end-to-end implementation.

  * **Tier 1: Foundational EDA (Projects 1-10):** Focus on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
  * **Tier 2: Basic Machine Learning (Projects 11-20):** Applying core `scikit-learn` models for regression, classification, and clustering.
  * **Tier 3: Intermediate ML & Topics (Projects 21-24):** Exploring specialized areas like NLP, Time Series, and Dimensionality Reduction.
  * **Tier 4: Advanced & End-to-End (Projects 25-30):** Building complex, portfolio-ready projects including Recommender Systems, Deep Learning, and API Deployment.
